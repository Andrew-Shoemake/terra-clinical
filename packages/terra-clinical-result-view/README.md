The Clinical Result View is a small stateless view that is intended to show measurements such as labs and vitals. The view is designed in a way that it can handle a single measurement (such as weight), but also show paired measurements such as blood pressure. In a clinical setting, each measurement can have additional metadata associated on the result, like whether it's a critical value or has been modified, or even if it's an unexpected value.
